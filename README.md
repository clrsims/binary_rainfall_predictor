# XGBoost classification machine learning model for forecasting rainfall based on meterological data.
## Top Kaggle Submission
### Used a Kaggle dataset of meterological data including pressure, maxtemp, temperature, dewpoint, humidity, etc... to forecast whether it was going to rain.
### Tech stack: Jupyter Notebooks, Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and xgboost).
### Techniques used: exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, feature engineering, time-series & lag feature creation, model training, data scaling & preprocessing, XGBoost, logisitic regression, data engineering.
